Require:
List of recognition sites for restriction enzymes
	if possible: information on sites most amenable to mismatches by each enzyme

Input mutant and WT sequence
	Require: each sequence to start and end on homologous bases
	Ex: GCnnnnnnnAT and GCnnnnAT, where the GC and AT are the start/end of the sequence and there's varying inner content between the two alleles

Input maximum permissible number of mismatches


Align start and end of sequences, find the regions in the middle where you begin to have mismatches
	EX: the pair GCATATGAGAGCCC
	             GCATATGCCC
		would be compared as having a matched start sequence of GCATATG and a matches end sequence of GCCC
	We want to find a break point and the shared region
		
Loop over mismatch number:
	Find all permissible restriction sites in the entire sequence and check whether they overlap with the non-shared region of the sequences
	to do this:
		run recognition site over sequence
			calculate hamming distance for each location, store
		find all locations where hamming distance == mismatch number (modify hamming distance by enzyme permissibility information?)
		
	evaluate cases for any given site:
		site entirely within nonshared sequence, with or without mismatch required - you just have a CAPS primer, you're done.
		site partially within nonshared sequence in one sequence but not another, with or without mismatch required - you have your dCAPS primer
		site entirely within shared sequence - no CAPS or dCAPS primer possible
	
	if none, increase permissible mismatch number
	
output all possible CAPS/dCAPS primers that differentiate the two sequences
